FrugalInnovationProject
=======================

CoEn 161 Final Project
We have two links: 
The main page-
http://students.engr.scu.edu/~nlam/deliverable2/
The dashboard-
http://students.engr.scu.edu/~aprabhak/FrugalInnovationSuperUser/dashboardMain.html

The dashboard is for admins of the Frugal Innovation lab- it basically presents the data in the donations database and the proposals database so that they can view it. This is functionality we felt was important to implement because otherwise the page becomes a black box- data going in and no data displayed. 

The main page has all the functionality.
